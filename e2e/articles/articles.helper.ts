    "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift to remote work, but it was only the beginning of a larger transformation. By 2030, it's expected that nearly 50% of the global workforce will work remotely at least part-time. Key drivers include advanced collaboration tools, the proliferation of AI-driven productivity apps, and a stronger emphasis on work-life balance. Organizations are rethinking their office spaces, often opting for hybrid models where employees can choose how and where they work. Meanwhile, workers are relocating to smaller towns and more affordable regions, no longer tethered to company headquarters.
